##Filtering columns and rows
(had to use sqldf becuase dplyr was acting wonky)
sqldf allows one to use standard query language sytanx to pull data from dataframes.
with this I queried the Batting table in the Lahman package

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
sqldf("select playerID, yearID, teamID, HR 
      from Batting
      WHERE teamID == 'NYA' and yearID == 1927")
```
